Wall Following: Attach the ultrasonic sensor to your robot using the provided 3D-printed
mount and measure the distance between the robot and the wall. If you prefer a different
sensor angle, design a custom mount in CAD and 3D print it at Nolop. The robot should
maintain a consistent distance from the wall.
